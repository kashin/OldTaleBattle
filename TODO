// Write here anything that you want to do with a current code (no new features here :) )
0) Move Damage related classes into a separate script.
1) Create a general Stats class that will contain similar properties for Mobs and Player.
2) Update InGame UI implementation. We shouldn't always update Health/Mana level in Update() method. So, it is better to implement callbacks for healthChanged and manaChanged signals from Player's stats.
3) Remove collider from mobs when they are starting death animation.
