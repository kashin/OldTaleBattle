- Add Agility usage for Action Points in Story mode.
- Move Damage related classes into a separate script.
- Create a general Stats class that will contain similar properties for Mobs and Player.
- Update InGame UI implementation. We shouldn't always update Health/Mana level in Update() method. So, it is better to implement callbacks for healthChanged and manaChanged signals from Player's stats.
- Remove collider from mobs when they are starting death animation.
- Limit on max mobs count on a map at the same time?
- Increase performance (mobs limit on map at the same time and probably something else).
